# book-recommender-system

Book recommender system is a Collaborative filtering-based Recommender System using Machine Learning, NumPy, Pandas, Python, Flask, and Kaggle Dataset.

The purpose of this system was to get an idea of how Facebook's automatic friend tagging suggestions and e-commerce sites suggesting necessary items algorithms work.

How I loaded the dataset, How the machine learned from the data and made a model. And how the machine makes predictions based on that
acquired knowledge. To understand these terms and algorithms please visit this file 👉🏻 `book-recommender-system.ipynb`

Kaggle Dataset 👉🏻 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset

Thanks and happy coding.
